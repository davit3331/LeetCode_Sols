Algorithm RandomizedJugMatch(red_jugs, blue_jugs):
    //Input: red_jugs - an array of red jugs, blue_jugs - an array of blue jugs
    //Output: Pairs each red jug with its matching blue jug

    1. If red_jugs or blue_jugs contains only one jug:
         a. Pair the red jug with the blue jug and return.

    2. Choose a random blue jug as the pivot_blue_jug.

    3. Partition red_jugs into two groups:
         a. smaller_red_jugs: all red jugs with volume smaller than pivot_blue_jug.
         b. larger_red_jugs: all red jugs with volume larger than pivot_blue_jug.

    4. Find the red jug that matches pivot_blue_jug by comparing volumes.
         a. Let pivot_red_jug be the red jug that has the same volume as pivot_blue_jug.

    5. Pair pivot_red_jug with pivot_blue_jug.

    6. Recursively apply RandomizedJugMatch on:
         a. smaller_red_jugs and all blue jugs smaller than pivot_blue_jug.
         b. larger_red_jugs and all blue jugs larger than pivot_blue_jug.

    7. Return the pairs of red and blue jugs.
